1,"What are the best NRCRI cassava varieties for high yield?","NRCRI has developed several high-yielding cassava varieties. TME 419 is very popular for its high yield and resistance to Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD). Another good choice is VITACASS, which is rich in Vitamin A."
2,"Which yam varieties from NRCRI are recommended for farmers in Abia State?","For farmers in Abia State, NRCRI recommends varieties like UMUDr-17 (TDr 95/19177) and UMUDr-19 (TDr 89/02475). [16] These varieties are known for good yields and are well-adopted in the region. [13]"
3,"I heard about a new yam variety called 'SHARP-SHARP'. What is it?","Yes, 'SHARP-SHARP' is a new, early-maturing yam variety launched by NRCRI. [5] Its main advantage is that it can be harvested much sooner than traditional varieties, allowing farmers to get to market faster."
4,"How can I get improved cassava stems?","NRCRI plays a major role in the multiplication and distribution of improved planting materials. [22] You can contact their extension services unit or look for accredited agro-dealers who partner with the institute. [11]"
5,"What is the 'minisett technology' for yams?","The 'minisett technology' is a method developed for the rapid multiplication of seed yams. [13, 16] It allows farmers to produce a large number of seed yams from a small number of mother tubers, which is more efficient and cost-effective than traditional methods."
6,"What is the correct spacing for planting cassava?","The correct spacing depends on your cropping system. For sole cassava planting, a spacing of 1 meter by 1 meter is recommended. If you are intercropping with other plants like maize or legumes, you may need to adjust the spacing accordingly. [22]"
7,"How do I control Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD)?","The most effective way to control CMD is by planting resistant varieties developed by NRCRI, such as TME 419. [22] You should also make sure to use clean, disease-free stems for planting and remove any infected plants you find in your field."
8,"What pests affect yams and how can I control them?","Yam farms can be affected by yam beetles and other pests. To control them, it is recommended to practice crop rotation, use clean and healthy seed yams, and apply appropriate pesticides as advised by agricultural extension agents. [13]"
9,"My cocoyam leaves have spots and are dying. What could be the problem?","This could be Cocoyam Leaf Blight disease. [13] To manage it, ensure good field sanitation by removing infected leaves. Also, proper plant spacing can improve air circulation and reduce the spread of the disease."
10,"How can I manage weeds on my farm effectively?","Effective weed management can be achieved through a combination of methods. You can use manual weeding, apply recommended herbicides before and after planting, and practice intercropping, which can help suppress weed growth. [22]"
11,"What is the best way to prepare my land for planting yams?","Proper land preparation is key for a good yam harvest. You should clear the land and can create heaps or ridges. NRCRI recommends minimum tillage where possible to help control soil erosion. [17]"
12,"Do I need to use fertilizer for my cassava crop?","Yes, using fertilizer can significantly increase your cassava yield. NRCRI research shows that applying NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) fertilizer is beneficial. The correct type and dosage depend on your soil's fertility. [15]"
13,"How do I know the right amount of fertilizer to use?","The best way to know is through a soil test. However, a general recommendation is to apply a balanced NPK fertilizer a few weeks after planting. You can get specific advice for your area from the NRCRI extension services. [11, 17]"
14,"What is intercropping and why is it useful?","Intercropping is the practice of growing two or more crops on the same piece of land. It is useful because it can improve soil health (if you plant legumes), reduce pests and diseases, and give you multiple harvests from one plot. Cassava and yam are often intercropped with maize, vegetables or melon. [14]"
15,"When is the best time to harvest cassava?","Cassava maturity depends on the variety. Early-maturing varieties can be ready in 8-10 months, while others may take up to 12-15 months. It is best to harvest when the soil is moist to make uprooting the tubers easier. [22]"
16,"My cassava roots spoil quickly after harvesting. How can I prevent this?","This is called post-harvest deterioration. To reduce it, try to process the cassava within 24-48 hours of harvesting. If you must store them, you can keep them in the ground until you are ready, or store them in a cool, dry place. NRCRI is actively researching ways to breed varieties with longer shelf life. [22]"
17,"How can I add value to my cassava harvest?","You can add value by processing your cassava into products like garri, fufu, or high-quality cassava flour (HQCF). [15] These products have a longer shelf life and can be sold at a higher price than raw tubers."
18,"What are the benefits of orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP)?","Orange-fleshed sweet potato is a special type of sweet potato that is very rich in Vitamin A. Promoting its cultivation is a key goal for NRCRI to help improve nutrition in communities. [23]"
19,"What is the main goal of the National Root Crops Research Institute (NRCRI)?","The main goal of NRCRI is to research and develop improved varieties and technologies for root and tuber crops like cassava, yam, and potato. [3, 7] They aim to increase food security, create employment, and boost the income of farmers in Nigeria. [4]"
20,"How can I get more information and training from NRCRI?","NRCRI has an Extension Services unit dedicated to training farmers and disseminating new research findings. [6, 11] They use demonstration plots, radio programs, and print materials to educate farmers on the latest technologies. [11] You can contact the institute directly in Umudike, Abia State. [5]"
